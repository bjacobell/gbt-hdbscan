This repository contains my scratch-work notebooks for a Breakthrough Listen project involving HDBSCAN for Green Bank Telescope data, 
titled "Anomaly Detection and RFI Classification with Unsupervised Learning in Narrowband Radio Technosignature Searches."

Comment-style documentation is present but not ubiquitous; the notebooks are not meant to constitute a library or a set of tutorials. 
If you're interested and need help finding a specific bit of code, feel free to reach out!
